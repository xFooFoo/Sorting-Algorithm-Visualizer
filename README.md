# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
Currently, it can only visualize bubble/insertion/selection sort.

Features to add:
- More customization UI's (speed, pause/play, max values, number of data values, exit button)
- Better looking selection buttons

Bugs to fix:
- Getting quicksort visualize properly...
