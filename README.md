# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
Currently, it can only visualize bubble/insertion/selection sort.

To-do List:
- More customization UI's (speed, pause/play, max values, number of data values, exit button)
- Better-looking selection buttons
- Organise my code better by creating new classes and files
- Visualise heapsort and mergesort

Bugs to fix:
